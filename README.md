Predicting Survival on the Titanic: A Machine Learning Journey

🚢 Introduction
In my recent project, I tackled the challenge of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. This classic dataset from Kaggle provided a rich ground for exploring data analysis and predictive modeling.

🔍 Project Overview
The goal was to analyze various features such as age, gender, class, and fare to determine their impact on survival rates. I employed several machine-learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, to build my predictive models.

📊 Key Findings
Feature Importance: The analysis revealed that gender and passenger class were significant predictors of survival.
Model Performance: My best model achieved an accuracy of 77.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of feature engineering and model selection.
